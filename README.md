# Dexi — Decentralized Fantasy Sports on Solana

**TxLINE Solana Colosseum Hackathon 2026 — Data-Driven Web3 Platforms Track**

Dexi is a decentralized fantasy sports protocol built on Solana using the Anchor framework. Users trade athlete tokens on constant-product AMMs, draft 11-player lineups, and win USDC prizes — all verified and settled using live TxLINE World Cup data.

**Devnet Program ID:** `HLqcxyy9DrVH7DJ2NqTza8Vq6GWB4aUuUSjFWdq5EAmt`

**Devnet USDC Mint:** `9Y27Cm2eWZ1H6KzMss5Py4BhRPBMYKCssEoWBp2MunEP`

---

## How It Works

1. **Trade athlete tokens** — Buy/sell tokens for real World Cup players via on-chain CPMM bonding curves
2. **Draft your lineup** — Enter fantasy contests with 11-athlete lineups (role-based constraints: GK, DEF, MID, FWD)
3. **TxLINE resolves scores** — The keeper bot fetches live match events (goals, assists, saves) from TxLINE's SSE stream to compute fantasy scores
4. **Win USDC** — Prizes are distributed on-chain from the contest escrow vault

## TxLINE Integration

Dexi uses TxLINE as its primary data source for live match resolution:

- **`/api/scores/snapshot/{fixtureId}?asOf={timestamp}`** — Fetches real-time match events for the 104 World Cup fixtures. The keeper bot polls this endpoint to detect goals, assists, saves, and match completion (`statusSoccerId === 'F'`) for automated contest settlement.
- TxLINE's low-latency SSE stream powers live score display in the frontend, keeping fans engaged with real-time leaderboard updates as matches unfold.

## Features

- **Athlete Token Markets** — Buy/sell athlete tokens via CPMM bonding curves
- **Fantasy Contests** — Draft 11-athlete lineups with role-based constraints (GK, DEF, MID, FWD)
- **Prize Pool Mechanics** — 90% of staked entry tokens swapped to USDC for prizes, 10% burned
- **Keeper Automation** — Off-chain bot monitors TxLINE data and manages contest lifecycle (lock, process mints, settle)
- **Address Lookup Tables** — V0 versioned transactions for compressed contest entry
- **Devnet Deployed** — Fully functional on Solana devnet

## Program Accounts

| Account | PDA Seed | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `AdminConfig` | `"admin"` | Global config (admin, keeper, USDC mint, fee, treasury) |
| `AthletePool` | `"pool"` + mint | Per-athlete CPMM pool with role, name, enabled flag |
| `Contest` | `"contest"` + id (u64 LE) | Tournament state with prize split, escrow, ALT |
| `UserEntry` | `"entry"` + contest + user | User's 11-athlete lineup and claim status |

## Instructions

| Instruction | Caller | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `initialize` | Admin | Create global admin config |
| `update_config` | Admin | Update USDC mint, swap fee, keeper, treasury |
| `create_pool` | Admin | Init athlete pool + vaults |
| `update_pool` | Admin | Rename/disable/enable pool |
| `buy` | User | USDC → athlete tokens (CPMM) |
| `sell` | User | Athlete tokens → USDC (CPMM) |
| `create_contest` | Admin | Create contest with prize split, vaults, ALT |
| `enter_contest` | User | Validate lineup, stake 11 tokens (single tx) |
| `lock_contest` | Keeper | Open → Locked at start_time |
| `process_entry_mint` | Keeper | Swap 90% → USDC, burn 10% per mint |
| `settle_contest` | Keeper | Locked → Settled, snapshot prize pool |
| `claim_reward` | User + Keeper | Claim USDC prize (co-signed) |
